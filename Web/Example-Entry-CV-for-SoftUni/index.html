                        <p>
                            I’m 19 years old. Born and raised in town Bregovo, Vidin region. Aspiring to become a good software developer/engineer.
                            I’m hard-working and investing at least 5 hours per day since the past 4 months, to develop myself as a software developer.
                            <br />
                            My passion for programming/web development starts since the younger age, about 14 or 16 years old, due to games and more
                            precisely World of Warcraft, I had the motivation to learn SQL and XHTML so I could help the bulgarian non-profit,
                            non-official servers, owners to maintain and update their servers. I was doing basic stuff, but I was happy and learning.
                            <br />
                            Later I signed up for a coursera.org Python course which I completed and earned a <a href="http://syndbg.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/coursera-antonantonov.pdf" target="_blank" title="click to see it">statement of accomplishment</a> for it.
                            This was my first introduction to a real programming language.
                            However the real learning began when I was introduced to C in university. Disappointed by the super-old teaching methods
                            and very inconsistent learning curve, I found books that would do a better job at teaching me, not C, which was already
                            an old language, but the more modern C++. By the last weeks of the semester, I was already sure that I have no place here
                            and definitely not on this level. I was looking for a challenge.
                            <br />
                            During a time span of 1 and a half month, I also passed an interview for a Java education in a just-starting software
                            company in Mladost 2. The candidates were 9, including me, who were to be taught Java from the basics by the business
                            owner and with the help of Mr. Nakov’s great intro Java book. But I realized that I was competing with guys who were at
                            least 2 and even more years older than me, who in my opinion, wasted their time in bad universities, like TU. I was sure
                            that I would not want to be like them. And yet I made the mistake to invest more time in the university at that time.
                            At one point I had to quit the job education. Due to bad time-management and I deeply regret it.
                            <br />
                            Starting a new year with better goal and determination, I signed-up for the Telerik Academy HTML basics and CSS styling
                            courses. I knew that these are definitely not the hardest courses in the academy, but I was and I’m still doing my homeworks
                            at least 4 weeks in advance. I feel like I could learn in a faster pace and I’m more than willing to commit my time into
                            it. 5-7 hours per day is definitely not my best, I could do better and be more efficient.
                            That’s why I’m here, applying for the definite best software education - Software University&copy;.

                            Quitted at first semester, January 2014, as it did not satisfy my needs for software engineering.
                            Also the learning curve/speed was rather
                            slow.
